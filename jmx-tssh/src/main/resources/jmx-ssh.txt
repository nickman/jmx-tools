The JMX-SSH Protocol
====================

Example:  service:jmx:tunnel://localhost:8006/ssh/jmxmp:u=nwhitehead,h=pdk-pt-ceas-03,pt=22,k=c,jmxu=admin,kp=helios

Here's how it breaks down:

 -	service:jmx:tunnel://
 	service url prefix and protocol declaration, the tunnel part specifies we're going to tunnel this connection
 	
 -	localhost:8006 	
 	The local socket we'll physically connect to
 	
 -	/ssh/jmxmp:
 	Once the tunnel is established, this subprotocol declaration specifies that we're tunneling using SSH (what else ? I don't know...)
 	and jmxmp is another JMX remoting protocol that will be tunneled through SSH.
 	
 -	(the remaining options are enumerated in org.helios.jmx.remote.tunnel.SSHOption) 	
 	
 -	u=<user name>
 	The user name to initiate the SSH connection with
 	 	
 -	h=<host-name or ip address>
 	The ssh host to tunnel through, i.e. where we will SSH connect to
 	
 -	pt=<ssh listener port, default is 22>
 	The ssh port to tunnel through, i.e. where we will SSH connect to
 	
 -	k=<path to private ssh key>
 	The path and file name of the private key to connect with
 	the example above is bogus. Here's a good one: k=/home/hankhill/.ssh/id_dsa
 	
 -	jmxu=<jmx user name>
 	The jmx user name for jmx authentication

 - 	kp=<private key passphrase>
 	The passphrase for the private key
 	

Other options are:

 -	jmxp=<jmx password>
 	The jmx password for jmx authentication

 -	p=<ssh user password>
 	The user password for ssh authentication
 	
 -	lp=<local tunnel port>
 	The port of the local side of the tunnel
 	
 -	sk=<validate server key>
 	(true/false) Indicates if the server key should be verified
 	requires the known host file to be configured (hf)
 	
 -	hf=<known hosts file>
 	the file name of the known hosts file to verify server keys
 	
 -	pr=<config props file>
 	the URL or file name of a properties from which all these properties can be read from
 	
 -	pref=<target server prefix>
 	the properties prefix to use when reading a props file containing multiple configurations
 	
 -	to=<connect timeout in ms>
 	The ssh connect timeout in ms.
 	
 -	kto=<key exchange timeout in ms>
 	The key exchange timeout in ms.
